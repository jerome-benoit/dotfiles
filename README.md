# Home Manager Configuration

Nix flakes configuration for Generic Linux and macOS.

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url> ~/.nix
cd ~/.nix

# Bootstrap
make bootstrap SPEC=work     # or SPEC=personal
```

Restart your shell.

## Usage

### Home Manager

```bash
# Apply changes (preserves current specialisation)
hm

# Switch specialisation
hmw  # work
hmp  # personal

# Or via Makefile
make switch SPEC=work
```

### Private configuration and credentials

Managed via [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops). Private configuration is decrypted at eval-time; runtime credentials are decrypted by sops-nix.

```bash
make decrypt-private  # Decrypt private configuration only for Nix evaluation
make decrypt          # Decrypt private configuration and credentials for inspection
make encrypt          # Re-encrypt private configuration and credentials after editing
make edit-private     # Edit private configuration interactively
make edit-credentials # Edit runtime credentials interactively
make clean            # Remove decrypted private configuration, credentials, and temporary files
```

### GPG keypair

Subkeys and passphrase are bundled, age-encrypted to the project's age recipient, and committed at `secrets/gpg/keypair.tar.gz.age`. Home-manager activation imports them idempotently on any machine where `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` is present.

```bash
make encrypt-gpg      # one-shot from a trusted machine; then commit the bundle
```

Recovery: with `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` + the git repo, SOPS secrets and GPG subkeys are recoverable. The GPG primary key is not in the bundle; back it up separately offline.

### Formatting

```bash
nix fmt              # Format all .nix files
nix fmt file.nix     # Format specific file
```

### Validation

```bash
nix flake check      # Run all checks:
                     # - Formatting verification
                     # - Symlinks validation
                     # - Build all home-manager configurations
```

### Maintenance

```bash
nix flake update     # Update inputs
nh clean all --keep 3
```
